This is a minimal example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Here you will find posts demonstrating how to use R Markdown features, such as [adding citations to posts](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-citations-to-posts/), [adding R Markdown documents of other output formats](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/), and [adding HTML widgets to posts](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/07/adding-htmlwidgets-to-r-markdown-posts/).
