This is a minimal example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Here you will find posts demonstrating how to use R Markdown features.

- In the post on [adding citations](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-citations-to-posts/), we show you how to add cites from an external BibTex file and how to cite R packages within a **blogdown** post.

- In the post on [adding R Markdown documents of other output formats](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/), we show you examples of how to render R Markdown documents as a PDF document and an HTML5 presentation using **blogdown**.

- In the post on [adding HTML widgets](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/07/adding-htmlwidgets-to-r-markdown-posts/), we show you examples of embedding a DataTable from the [DT package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) and an interactive plot using the [plotly package](https://plot.ly/r/).
